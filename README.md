# liri
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Node modules will need to be added from NPM 
I use inquire for prompts, there are default values stored
Twitter account is coded in, so expect to see MY tweets, not yours. 
Spotty() returns link and album name based off a track search: default is Ace of Base
You will get errors if the name of the album or song is misspelled or doesn't exist on spotify
Movied() takes a movie name or returns Mr. Nobody
 the DO IT reads form random.txt, this works two values for spotty and movied. It does not take in a second argument for tweets, so it will only return my tweets
